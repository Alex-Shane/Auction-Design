# Auction-Design

Auction house is split into numerous different categories so that it is easier for a user to find and bid on items they're interested in.

User must have proof of funds for the item they bid on in their account
	checks need to continue for each bid as the price goes up

Each bid after the auction is down to its last 45 seconds adds 30 more seconds to the auction. 

If you win an auction item, congratulations message pops up and provides a link to your wallet to view your newly won item.
	Also, if you win auction you get a very small percentage of wolvercoin back as an 	incentive to keep buying items from the auction house 

Creators of items in the auction house will have the choice to choose a royalty percentage for each time their item is sold.
	The members of the class will also receive a small percentage of the purchase 		price in wolvercoin

Users can vote on their favorite auction items, and the creator of the item with the most votes will get a wolvercoin reward as another incentive for people to add cool, desirable items to the auction house.
