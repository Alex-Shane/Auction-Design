# Auction-Design

Auction house is split into numerous different categories so that it is easier for a user to find and bid on items they're interested in.

User must have proof of funds for the item they bid on in their account BEFORE they make a bid
	checks need to continue for each bid as the price of an item goes up

Each bid after the auction is down to its last 45 seconds adds 30 more seconds to the auction. 

If you win an auction item, a congratulations message pops up and provides a link to your wallet to view your newly won item.
	Also, if you win an auction item you get a very small percentage of wolvercoin   back as an incentive to keep buying items from the auction house 
	If you reach a certain number of items won (such as 10, 25, 50, etc) you will also 	win a prize as further incentive to use our platform

Creators of items in the auction house will have the choice to choose a royalty percentage for each time their item is sold.
	The members of our comp sci class will also receive a small percentage of the  purchase price in wolvercoin

Users can vote on their favorite auction items, and the creator of the item with the most votes will get a wolvercoin reward as another incentive for people to add cool, desirable items to the auction house. 

Add chat feature for bidding: each time you make a bid you can attach a message with it that other people looking at this auction can view.
